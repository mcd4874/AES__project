Due: 11:59pm, Saturday, March 11

1. AES_Simulation.java (done!)
   - Main simulation engine
2. AES.java
   - A high level class that handles encryption and decryption
   - You need to complete the roundFunctionEncrypt and rouncFunctionDecrypt methods
3. KeySchedule.java (done!)
   - Generates an initial key and 10 round keys
4. Util.java
   - Contains several conversion funciton.
   - You need to complete the mulyiply method
5. KeyAdditionLayer.java
   - You need to complete the keyAddition method
6. SBox.java, InvSBox.java
   - Contains S-box and inverse S-box.
   - You need to complete the byteSubstitute methods in both classes
7. DiffusionLayer.java, InvDiffusionLayer.java
   - Contains shiftRow and mixColumn sublayers.
   - You need to complete the mixColumn sublayers in both classes
8. Data files
   plaintext.txt - a block of 16 bytes
   key0.txt, key1.txt - the main key of 16 bytes
   You may want to test your program with other plaintext and keys.
